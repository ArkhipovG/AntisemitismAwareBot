      "Among the main activities of my recent trips to Israel and Italy were visits to important religious sites and places of worship in Jerusalem, Haifa and Vatican City, with the aim of communicating to the public and to religious and political leaders that, from thousands of years ago, the ancient nation of Iran was a cradle of diversity and freedom for various religions and belief systems. Historically, the followers of different faiths in Iran worshipped freely and lived in peace and tolerance alongside each other. But from the moment that the Islamic Republic seized power in Iran, it targeted the lives and livelihoods of Iran’s Jewish, Baha’i, Christian, Zoroastrian, Sunni, Dervish, Yarsan and atheist communities, as well as the majority of Iranian Shias who opposed its repressive rule. In a future secular and democratic Iran, the rule of law will establish and guarantee freedom of religion as a fundamental right so that Iran can return to its roots as a nation where people of different faiths live and worship freely alongside each other., Answer: No\n",

      "On 9 March 2020, Emir Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the 14th Emir of Kano, was dethroned by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Reliable sources have it that he was dethroned because he opposed the ill-policies of Governor Ganduje. When he was dethroned, there was a serious outcry from the public considering the fact that SLS is incredibly popular. Before dethroning SLS, Governor Ganduje created four new emirates: Gaya, Rano, Karaye, and Bichi. After dethroning SLS, Aminu Ado became the new Emir of Kano.\n",

      "\n",
      "The fact that some people think if another governor comes, SLS will be dethroned is not a sufficient reason for him not to get his throne back. How sure are you that the governor who will succeed AKY is like Ganduje or that Kano might have a governor that will ever dethrone an Emir in SLS’s lifetime?\n",

The event commemorates the 75th anniversary of the Nakba (Arabic for Catastrophe), when over 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly removed from over 500 villages and cities in historic Palestine, never to return. The Nakba continues today — from Jerusalem to Gaza, Israel continues its policy of human rights abuses, displacing and oppressing the indigenous Palestinian population. The Palestinian people need our solidarity now more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "✊ We stand united with our friends at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and we support everyone who steps up to resist the Public Order Act, which has effectively banned peaceful protest in the UK. At the same time as crushing legitimate dissent in the UK, this criminal government is supporting apartheid in Palestine. The same financial institutions that are funding new fossil fuel projects in the UK are also funding the manufacture of weapons used to repress the Palestinian people and indiscriminately bomb the men, women and children trying to survive in the Gaza strip.\n",

Ordinary people must step up to resist imperialism and authoritarianism and must demand no new fossil fuels if we are to minimise the effects of climate collapse. Palestinians are among the most vulnerable people on Earth to the effects of climate collapse, and in the daily struggle to survive in an apartheid state, they have no capacity to protect themselves against what is coming.\n",

Israel's government should heed the voice of its citizens, aim to find consensus, and reaffirm a commitment to the checks and balances of democracy., Answer: No\n",
      "The U.S. Congressional Resolution on Israel is a sham! The painful truth is that the Israeli state - like the USA - has been racist in practice since its inception. The founding of the Jewish state in response to the indescribable evil of the Holocaust against Jewish humanity produced dispossession and domination of Palestinian peoples. This sad paradox of how a terrorized and traumatized people for two thousand years - precious Jewish people - reproduced terror and trauma for precious Palestinian people in the last seventy-five years reveals our human wretchedness. Massive denial of undeniable evil numbs us to the suffering of others and justifies naked power over the vulnerable. The courageous and compassionate human acknowledgment and resistance to any form of racism and domination is our only hope. The two-state solution has been undercut by hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers. A call for Palestinian dignity and justice and Jewish security and safety in a secular federated state with UN oversight is our best option! #Israel #Palestine, Answer: Yes\n",

      "A film which has been produced by a group of Australian journalists has sparked an international outcry against Israel after it explicitly detailed Tel Aviv's use of torture against Palestinian children.\n",
      "The film, titled ‘Stone Cold Justice’ documents how Palestinian children, who have been arrested and detained by Israeli forces, are subjected to physical abuse, torture and forced into false confessions and pushed into gathering intelligence on Palestinian activists. Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop has spoken out against Israeli's use of torture stating that “I am deeply concerned by allegations of the mistreatment of Palestinian children,” Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor has described the human rights abuses documented in the film as “intolerable”. But rights groups have slammed this statement, saying that the Israelis are doing nothing to change Tel Aviv's policy to torture Palestinian children. Last year a report by the United Nations International Emergency Children's Fund or UNICEF concluded that Palestinian children are often targeted in night arrests and raids of their homes, threatened with death and subjected to physical violence, solitary confinement and sexual assault. The film Stone Cold Justice has sparked an international outcry about Israel's treatment of children in Israeli jails. However, rights groups have criticized Tel Aviv for not doing anything to create a policy that protects Palestinian children against arbitrary arrest and torture.\", Answer: Yes\n",

      "Let’s talk about Azeri lobbying in Israel. I spent a long time not talking about this because I felt so much pressure as a journalist in Israel but I don’t want to be silent about this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Azerbaijan has heavily invested in lobbying in Israel at a government and PR level. They even have a fancy tourist center set up on the beach in Tel Aviv. This is a known tactic of Aliyev, who is an anti-democratic dictator as much as he “supports” Israel. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most unpleasant tactics I’ve seen is their buying off of journalists, public figures, and the media. I have personally witnessed utterly false claims being made both in private and public to the Israeli media by the Azeri lobby, which also pressures and harasses Israeli journalists when it comes to speaking out about Armenia. This is not the behavior of an “ally” certainly not of a democratic nation which respects free press. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a journalist myself, I’ve been invited on “educational tours” sponsored by the Azeri government more than once (which I refused). Many of my peers have both been invited and have gone themselves. I know of cases in which “important people” were literally given gifts of gold Jewellery by the Azeri government during their visit. This is their strategic approach, buttering up key journalists and public figures and bombarding them with false information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Azerbaijan has an aggressive global political agenda and spends an incredible amount of money lobbying Israel (and others) to promote it — money that Armenia simply doesn’t have. In another example, the Azeri lobby in Israel was behind the effort to essentially trick over 30 MKs into signing a letter supporting separatism in Iran in the Azeri provinces. Once I exposed this, more than 25 of them rescinded their signatures. This is emblematic of the Azeri lobby: dishonest, deceptive and loaded with money. But Azerbaijan, there are some people you can’t buy. \n",
      "\n",
      "For months, the Azeri regime has been promoting a completely false and fabricated narrative that the Azeris are Israel in this scenario with Armenia and they’re just “defending themselves” against “terrorists.” This is rooted in pan-Turkic ideology that seeks the complete destruction of the first Christian nation in the world (Armenia).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a blatant lie used justify ethnic cleansing from the disputed territory of #NagornoKarabakh, an area of 120,000 ethnic Armenians, historically Armenian for thousands of years, that’s surrounded by Azeris. This territory is surrounded by Azerbaijan because of how the Soviets drew the boundaries after the fall of the USSR. Azerbaijan has launched multiple wars and a blockade to drive our Armenians from their land, and they are much more powerful thanks to Israeli weapons. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the 2020 war, despite the risks, Armenia had offered to give up territorial claims in exchange for the guarantee that the Armenians in the territory will be protected — as Azerbaijan has previously committed massacres and ethnic cleansing of Armenian cities. In Nakhichevan, another territory which was historically Armenian but drawn into modern Azerbaijan’s borders, the Azeris destroyed 98% of the historical and religious sites of Armenians, attempting to erase their connection to the land, after a shameful campaign of ethnic cleansing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of agreeing to protect the human rights of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh today, Azerbaijan launched another war against Armenians including attacking civilian targets. This comes after months of incitement to violence and dehumanisation of Armenians by the Azeri government and media. \n",

      "Israel is starving & bombing a caged population of mostly children in Gaza while threatening to wipe the rest of its neighbors off the map. And I see privileged white Americans whining about their feelings & how they’re the real victims from the comfort of the US. It’s astounding., Answer: Yes\n",
      "We're being told that Israel needs to kill civilians by the thousands to eliminate Hamas, because Hamas must be destroyed to achieve a lasting peace. Every part of this is transparently false.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly the premise that Hamas must be eliminated to achieve peace is fallacious; peace can be achieved by eliminating the abuses and righting the wrongs which gave rise to Hamas in the first place. There's no rational reason to believe Hamas would continue to exist in its current iteration or keep waging violent resistance if the theft and injustice from 1948 onward were rolled back, refugees had the right to return, apartheid abuses were ended, and people were no longer kept in a giant concentration camp where they are deprived of basic human needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly the premise that you can bomb people into accepting an abusive status quo is self-evidently absurd. Even if Israel kills every single member of Hamas, there will be hundreds of thousands of survivors of this onslaught who see the depravity of Israel and refuse to accept it. You think all these orphaned boys and all these men who saw their loved ones ripped apart by military explosives are just going to be cool with the status quo from here on out? Of course not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Israel knows this, which is why its preferred solution is to kick all survivors of this onslaught out of Gaza and into refugee camps in the Sinai desert. It knows that nothing it's doing will actually work and it refuses to make the reparations that will work, so its only other option is the elimination of Gazans one way or the other. Ethnic cleansing and mass displacement is not \"peace\" by any stretch of the imagination, but it might allow Israel to keep its abusive status quo intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are Israel's only real options for sustainable stability: either right all the wrongs which led to this, or go the opposite direction and inflict far more wrongs to answer the Palestinian question once and for all.

      "\n",
      "\"All roads lead to Rome, but not all paths of criticism lead to antisemitism. It is possible to criticize the United States without being necessarily antisemitic. One can criticize the messianic Zionism of a part of the Israeli government without being antisemitic. One can support the idea of justice for the Palestinian people without being antisemitic. One can question an economic, cultural, financial system... As far as I know, a former [french] president of the republic campaigned denouncing the power of finance, he was not antisemitic!\n",

By constantly wanting to limit our ability to express ourselves, by no longer being able to say anything in the media under the pretext that it might mean [this or that] or be inconvenient, by tracking all forms of thought that can overshadow a strategy or policy, we are becoming what we are turning into, that is, a very diminished nation. \n",

      "\n",
      "You know, what I think about first and foremost by telling you this is the interests of Israel, the interest of the Jewish community: it is necessary to help oneself, that is, not to put oneself in a situation where one risks fueling criticism.

      "The Elders call for Israel to comply immediately with the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to protect Palestinians in Gaza from acts of genocide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elders also call for Israel’s allies to publicly affirm their respect for the Court’s ruling, and to use the political, military and financial leverage at their disposal to ensure Israel’s compliance with the provisional measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ICJ’s legally binding decision is a moment of the utmost gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli forces have killed over 25,000 Palestinians in Gaza, destroyed homes and infrastructure across the territory and displaced up to 1.9 million people. The Elders share the Court’s judgement that this scale of devastation risks causing irreparable harm to the people of Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel, as the occupying military power, must comply with the Court’s ruling and implement the provisional measures in full. This includes ensuring its military does not commit any acts of genocide against the Palestinian people as a protected group, including killing members of the group. It also includes preventing incitement to genocide, and enabling provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. An immediate step must be to lift the siege of Gaza and end the collective punishment of Palestinians.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elders support the Court’s emphasis that all parties to the conflict are bound by international humanitarian law, and its call for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "All states have a responsibility to respect the Court’s ruling. South Africa has shown moral leadership in bringing this case, and it is now incumbent on others – particularly Israel’s allies and the UN Security Council – to live up to their own moral and legal obligations to prevent acts of genocide, and support the ICJ’s ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a minimum, Israel’s allies must ensure they are not complicit in any atrocity crimes. The Elders thus reiterate their call for all countries providing military assistance to Israel to place this under review and set new conditions for future provision. Governments which provide military assistance in the knowledge that atrocities are being committed, or may be imminent, risk being complicit. Self-defence can never be a justification for atrocity crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For too long, Israel’s allies – particularly the United States and many European states – have provided political cover for its violations of international law. This impunity must end now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Political leaders who choose to disregard or undermine the Court’s ruling risk further weakening the international rule of law at a time when it is already acutely under threat. The UN Security Council has a vital role in ensuring compliance with the ICJ ruling and upholding the consistent application of international law. The world is watching.\n",

If they find something, literally anything, the smearmeisters and propagandists will run with it as far as they can.\n",

      "\n",
      "Raised with an infinite love for Palestine and a profound animosity towards Jews and Israel, I adhered sincerely to these beliefs because they were all I knew. During my pursuit of knowledge, I lived with a Jewish family in France in 2010, an experience that unveiled realities previously unknown or misrepresented to me in my youth. Radical Islamism conceals the truth, coercing its adherents to embrace falsehoods and reject substantial and historical truths.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assure you, I am not an agent compensated for my activism; I have paid the price for speaking out. Why do I persist? Because I was once deceived by the very lies and misconceptions I earnestly believed. This is why I implore you to heed my warning: justice for Palestinians cannot be achieved through mass intimidation and protests that deface your national symbols.

      "I’m a scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a longtime advocate for peace and for Palestinian rights. I have publicly opposed Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, and its blockade and now destruction of Gaza. I support the rights of students and faculty to peacefully protest against Israel, including by establishing protest encampments, such as the one on my campus at UCLA. I do not want these protest camps to be removed by the police, whose propensity for unnecessary and excessive use of force is well-established.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Jew, I do not personally feel threatened or unsafe because of the protest encampment at UCLA. I know some of the students taking part and believe they are well-intentioned. Many, probably most, of the protesters are simply horrified by the mass killing and near-famine in Gaza and want it to end. So do I. But I cannot join this protest because it is not just a protest against the war in Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the demands of the protest organizers is the demand to “sever all UC-wide connections to Israeli universities, including study abroad programs, fellowships, seminars, and research collaborations, and UCLA’s Nazarian Center.” Needless to say, I oppose the demand to boycott the Nazarian Center, which I direct. The Center is devoted to the academic study of Israel and has no ties to the Israeli government. I also oppose boycotting Israeli academic institutions and academic boycotts in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it isn’t only the demands of the protest organizers that I have a problem with. One of the organizations behind the protest, Students for Justice in Palestine, has expressed support for Hamas and has even celebrated the massacre of Israelis on October 7. Being in solidarity with Palestinians does not necessitate supporting Hamas. On the contrary, Hamas oppresses Palestinians and has no concern for the lives of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. They have openly stated that they are willing to sacrifice countless Palestinian lives—“martyrs”—for their cause, which is the ultimate eradication of Israel. They have spent billions building a vast underground network to protect themselves and their weaponry, but they haven’t built a single bomb shelter for Gazan civilians or sheltered them in their tunnels. They are prolonging the devastating war in Gaza, and the humanitarian crisis there, in order to maintain their power and authoritarian rule in Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that many people in the pro-Palestinian movement don’t support Hamas and don’t praise the October 7 massacre, but groups like SJP lead the movement on many college campuses, exploiting the sympathy that many students rightly feel for the suffering of Palestinians. Students and faculty demonstrating in support of Palestinians shouldn’t ignore the fact that the organizers of these demonstrations are, in many cases, ideologically committed to eradicating Israel and expelling Israeli Jews, supportive of violence against Israeli civilians, and willing to ignore or even justify Hamas’ strategy of sacrificing Palestinian civilians for their political ends., Answer: No\n",
