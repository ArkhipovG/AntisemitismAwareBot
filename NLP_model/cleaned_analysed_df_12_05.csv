Israel has the world’s highest concentration of tech companies outside of Silicon Valley and the world’s highest number of startup companies per capita. Some of the most innovative companies in the world are Israeli such as Mobeleye Wix and Waze. 

Israel is the only country in the world that has more trees today than it did 50 years ago.
Israel is the only country in the world that has more water than it did 50 years ago, due to super advanced desalination technology. How does a country have more trees and more water? 

Israel has the highest number of museums per capita in the world. It has more museums than McDonald’s. 

Abortion is not just legal in Israel, it is actually paid for by the government under the universal national healthcare system. 

Israel has the highest percentage of vegans per capita in the world, with an estimated 5% of the population following a vegan diet. And they don’t feel the need to constantly tell you about it. 

Israel is the only country in the world that uses a language that has been dead for 2000 years! Hebrew! The one from the Bible. 

According to the World Health Organization Israel has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, with an average life expectancy of 84.7 years. 

Israel is the second country in the world to have a woman Prime Minister and Wonder Woman is Israeli too! 

According to the 2022 World Happiness Report, Israel is the fourth happiest country in the world. 

Despite being constantly under attack and surrounded by some countries who are not that into her, the people of Israel are amazing. They are patriotic, passionate and appreciative.

Historically, the followers of different faiths in Iran worshipped freely and lived in peace and tolerance alongside each other. But from the moment that the Islamic Republic seized power in Iran, it targeted the lives and livelihoods of Iran’s Jewish, Baha’i, Christian, Zoroastrian, Sunni, Dervish, Yarsan and atheist communities, as well as the majority of Iranian Shias who opposed its repressive rule.

In 1967, Israel absorbed a major part of historical Palestine and expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes. Today, the majority of right-thinking people support Palestine, hoping they get back what truly belongs to them.

On 9 March 2020, Emir Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the 14th Emir of Kano, was dethroned by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Reliable sources have it that he was dethroned because he opposed the ill-policies of Governor Ganduje. When he was dethroned, there was a serious outcry from the public considering the fact that SLS is incredibly popular. Before dethroning SLS, Governor Ganduje created four new emirates: Gaya, Rano, Karaye, and Bichi. After dethroning SLS, Aminu Ado became the new Emir of Kano.

SLS has a great personality. I used to envy Kano for having such a person as their Emir. After he left Kano, he was crowned the Khalifa of the Tijjaniyya Sufi Order in Nigeria. I was so happy because I can now have him as my leader as well, considering the fact that anyone can join Tijjaniyya.

After the just-concluded 2023 elections, Abba Kabir Yusuf was elected the new governor of Kano. AKY is in good terms with SLS and is set to restore Kano State back to its glory days, making sure the ill-policies of Governor Ganduje are all reviewed accordingly. This has sparked a debate about whether SLS will be reinstated or not. Some are of the opinion that SLS should come back, while others are saying he shouldn’t.

To me, this can be compared to some extent with the Israel vs Palestine story I mentioned earlier.

There is nothing wrong with SLS wanting his throne back. A king was dethroned without any proper reason, and some are here saying he shouldn’t go back. At least, he is trying to get it back through a healthy process. Most of us don’t know how heavy dethronement is on a king.

The fact that some people think if another governor comes, SLS will be dethroned is not a sufficient reason for him not to get his throne back. How sure are you that the governor who will succeed AKY is like Ganduje or that Kano might have a governor that will ever dethrone an Emir in SLS’s lifetime?

The Emirs that were used by Governor Ganduje in his game shouldn’t have allowed him to use them, for definitely, a day like this is bound to come.

I believe that as long as it is morally right for SLS to get his throne back, there’s no reason for us common people to be against it.

If we always ignore the wrong things that were done that affected our state and move on without advising against those decisions, we would be surprised at the results in the long run.

Here’s a simple question for those who are against SLS’s return: Imagine if a governor bans the whole traditional monarchies, will you support his successor to revive it back?

May God choose what is better for both SLS and Kano, amin.

The ongoing hostilities between Israel and Palestine have reached a critical point, marked by continuous attacks on Gaza over the past five days, tragically resulting in the deaths of at least 33 Palestinians and 1 Israeli.

Israel claims that these attacks specifically targeted leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement.

Palestinian militants launched a barrage of rockets towards Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Israeli settlements.

An immediate truce in Gaza is not currently being considered by Israel, as they firmly assert that the responsibility to stop launching rockets lies with the Palestinian armed groups.

On the opposing side, the armed wing of Islamic Jihad has declared their determination to continue launching rocket attacks as long as the fighting persists. They assert that they have been preparing for this confrontation for months.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad possesses approximately 6,000 rockets, while Hamas reportedly possesses four times that number in their arsenal.

Headlines today by both sides show the increased risk of a new full-blown war breaking out:

🦺 Today, Just Stop Oil supporters marched in solidarity with people affected by the Government’s anti-democratic assault on our legitimate right to protest, joining the march and rally for Palestine organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. The event commemorates the 75th anniversary of the Nakba (Arabic for Catastrophe), when over 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly removed from over 500 villages and cities in historic Palestine, never to return. The Nakba continues today — from Jerusalem to Gaza, Israel continues its policy of human rights abuses, displacing and oppressing the indigenous Palestinian population. The Palestinian people need our solidarity now more than ever.

✊ We stand united with our friends at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and we support everyone who steps up to resist the Public Order Act, which has effectively banned peaceful protest in the UK. At the same time as crushing legitimate dissent in the UK, this criminal government is supporting apartheid in Palestine. The same financial institutions that are funding new fossil fuel projects in the UK are also funding the manufacture of weapons used to repress the Palestinian people and indiscriminately bomb the men, women and children trying to survive in the Gaza strip.

⚖️ This government is engaged in a wholesale assault on human rights here and around the world — migrants’ rights, workers’ rights, protest rights — nothing is sacred. The Public Order Act has criminalised peaceful dissent. Anyone speaking up about the injustices wrought on Palestinians or calling out the corruption and criminality of the UK Government risks arrest. Ordinary people must step up to resist imperialism and authoritarianism and must demand no new fossil fuels if we are to minimise the effects of climate collapse. Palestinians are among the most vulnerable people on Earth to the effects of climate collapse, and in the daily struggle to survive in an apartheid state, they have no capacity to protect themselves against what is coming.

4 Let those who fear the Lord now say,

“The Illegal Organs Included Children”

INTERPOL: The Israeli market for donor organs has been well-documented, and most international trafficking rings have involved wealthy Israeli patients on so-called ""transplant tours"". Organ donation in Israel is low due to concerns in the Orthodox community about the body after death.

Only 10% of Israeli adults hold donor cards, compared with more than 30% in most western countries. Israel has launched a scheme in an attempt to increase donor rates. 

Recipients of organs illegally tranplanted in a private hospital in South Africa were described as Israelis. The donors – said to have included children – were Brazilians and Romanians paid $6,000 (£3,869) for a kidney. Netcare of South Africa, which also runs hospitals in Britain, admitted in court to receiving R3.8m (£342,000) from an illegal organ trafficking syndicate.

Israel has a parliamentary system in which majority out of 120 seats is required to create a government. Because of years of bad blood and mistrust of Benjamin Netanyahu, no one from the center was willing to form a government with him again, and he created a coalition with the extreme right and ultra orthodox, which are not the majority of the country. 

Israel does not have a constitution and the Israeli Declaration of Independence is what Israel uses as the basis upon which the country is run and the courts rule. 

The Supreme Court sometimes leaned on what’s called the Reasonableness Doctrine to rule. Over the years, many in Israel saw this as an overreach of the courts, accusing the Supreme Court of being an activist court. 

When the new government was swarm in, they went proposed a series of laws to weaken the Supreme Court. And the Israeli public rebelled, and for over 30 weeks has been protesting this proposed judicial overhaul. 

Because of these demonstrations, the majority of the laws which were originally proposed have already been taken off the table, but the first law just passed to not allow the reasonableness doctrine be used by the courts anyone. 

I have been asked about the stats and the fact that most Israelis do not support this move and the new numbers are in and they could not be more clear. 62% of the Israeli public thinks an overhaul should either be reached by a consensus or the entire legislation should be abandoned. Only 22% thinks the overhaul should continue as is. 

Now. Is Israel still a democracy? Absolutely it is. Is it being stress tested? Of course. But as we know from thousands of years of history, Judaism in and of itself is about a debate. We have been debating over everything for generations and we are debating now. And as always, this will make us stronger. 

So yes, these are trying and debate-full times in Israel. But I believe in Israel because I believe in the Israeli people and you should too. Am Israel Chai",noatishby,https://x.com/noatishby,"LA, TLV. ",240072,378,2009-04-02,1190,43,263,Unknown,False,True

The Jewish people are an ancient religious collective. 

Our relationship with the Holy Land was and is purely spiritual. When we ask for GD to rebuild Jerusalem, it’s not about nationalism. But rather GD’s Presence to return to the Holy Land.

Zionists know that they are distorting Judaism, but do they care?

EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (WKBN) – Independent testing in East Palestine is showing what’s being called an alarming increase in dioxin levels.

The testing was done at Sulphur Run Creek by scientist Scott Smith.

“Something has happened where the dioxins have increased in the sediment and to be clear, we need continued testing of sediment. Again, you can’t find what you don’t look for,” Smith said.

“What happened between February, March 8, and May 29. There have been excavations, remediation of the burn pits, residents have continued to complain — even last week,” Smith said.

He says the increase in dioxin levels is alarming and it’s something that needs to be looked into further. He feels testing should be continuous, especially at Sulphur Run Creek.

Scott Smith response to EPA's Public Information Officers:  ""That is not accurate as to my meeting with the EPA and it is unfortunate that the EPA public relations people have chosen this path. The EPA is now operating with the typical PR playbook of Delay, Deny, Discredit, Dismiss, and Defame. The EPA has refused to provide details to me and the experts on my team.""

‘ There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians.
Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians, another recent invention, Syrians, Iraqis, etc. 
Keep in mind that the Arabs control 99.9 per cent of Middle East lands . Israel represents one tenth of one per cent of the landmass . But that is too much for the Arabs. They want it all. And that is ultimately what the fighting around Israel is all about . No matter how many concessions the Israelis make , it will never be enough ‘.

Let us see what other Arabs have stated -
Ibn Taymiyyah ( 1263 - 1328 ) one of Islam’s foremost scholars 
‘ In Jerusalem there is not a place one calls sacred and the same holds true for the tombs of Hebron ‘

Yousef Diya al - Khalidi , Ottoman Mayor of Jerusalem, 1899
‘ Zionism is natural , beautiful and just ...who could contest the rights of the Jews in Palestine ? My God , historically it is your country ‘.

‘There is no such thing as Palestine in history- absolutely not ‘ .
Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi , Syrian Arab Diplomatic Leader to the British Peel Commission 1937 
‘ There is no such country as Palestine . Palestine is a term the Zionists invented . There is no Palestine in the Bible ‘.

Professor Philip Hitti . the most learned Arab scholar on Islamic affairs of the 20th century, 1946
‘There’s no such country as Palestine - absolutely not and never was ‘

Ahmed Shukan - Saudi Diplomat at the U.N. 1956 
‘ It is common knowledge that Palestine is part of Syria’

Hafez Assad , Syrian Dictator to PLO leader Yassir Arafat 
‘ You do not represent Palestine - there is no such thing as a Palestinian people’

Zuhair Mushin , military commander of the PLO and member of the PLO Executive Council 
‘ There are no differences between Jordanians , Syrians , Lebanese . We are all part of one nation. It is only for political reasons that we carefully underline our Palestinian identity ...yes the existence of a separate Palestinian identity serves only tactical purposes. The founding of a Palestinian State is just a tool in the battle against Israel’

Walid Shoebat - former PLO terrorist

PM Kakar went to US for a UNGA address. He could have sent his foreign minister but chose to go himself. There he spoke at length about Hindutwa, BJP, RSS, Kashmir, Palestine and such things. Didn’t say anything of consequence regarding Pakistan.

He tried to meet senior American officials. Everyone ignored him. Apparently, he met a junior bureaucrat of the state department.

Then he went to UK. He again tried to meet senior people but no one met him. Rumours say that he wanted to touch down for a day in Saudi Arabia but that too didn’t happen.

Why do Pakistani PMs & senior leaders insist on going to countries uninvited and bring shame upon their country? And the Pakistani people are also to blame - they never hold their leaders accountable. All the leader has to say is - Hindu, Hindutva, Yahoodi, Sazish, Kashmir, Palestine - and all is forgiven. 

No one asks any questions.

The Palestine Writes festival has been going on for a couple of years, to celebrate Palestinian creative endeavors, which is great. Thus year, the festival was hijacked by a bunch of racists, and a significant portion of the speakers are outright antisemites with a clear obsession against the Jewish state.

I’m not for cancel culture I don’t want the festival to be canceled, however, this conference is sponsored by university academic departments it’s funded in part by university affiliates. It’s happening on campus and some students are forced to attend it.

This festival has Roger Waters as a speaker for crying out loud. What does Roger Waters have to do with Palestinian literature? This entire event is an antisemitic dog whistle. They can’t hide it from the Jewish community. We see it for what this is. Penn Administration might not see what this is but we do.

The letter that was put out is not enough. The university should specifically denounce the event for what it is racism condemn the organizers and don’t contribute funds to it or host on campus. The university should also look into how this conference was hijacked by known antisemites, such as Susan Abulawa. 

And the main problem is that an event like this would not have been tolerated if it would’ve been any other marginalized group. An event like this is only acceptable when it’s specifically targeting the Jewish community again right on the Eve of Yom Kippur. This is a disgrace and should be forcefully rejected.

In October 2021, Shlomi Katzin was exploring a natural cove off the Carmel coast when he spotted the encrusted weapon. At the time, it was found alongside a few other artifacts, including pottery fragments and metal anchors. The sword itself is believed to be made of iron and measures about a meter in length. It weighed 4 lbs at the time of discovery.

The find came as little surprise as the area is well known to archaeologists. It is believed that over the centuries, ships would often take shelter within the protective walls provided by these types of formations. In present day, natural coves like this have become common locations for artifact sightings.

Experts believe crusader ships began traveling this route during the 11th century, and that it was sometime during one of these trips that the sword in question was somehow lost in the cove. To everyone's surprise, the sword appears to be in near-perfect condition under the layers of shells and other marine organisms that currently coat it. It is expected to soon be placed on display for public viewing, after the Israeli National Treasure's department finishes its examination and cleaning of this fascinating piece of history.",historyinmemes,https://x.com/historyinmemes,Unknown,5342871,213,2017-04-21,3047,22,267,Unknown,False,True

A film which has been produced by a group of Australian journalists has sparked an international outcry against Israel after it explicitly detailed Tel Aviv's use of torture against Palestinian children.
The film, titled ‘Stone Cold Justice’ documents how Palestinian children, who have been arrested and detained by Israeli forces, are subjected to physical abuse, torture and forced into false confessions and pushed into gathering intelligence on Palestinian activists. Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop has spoken out against Israeli's use of torture stating that “I am deeply concerned by allegations of the mistreatment of Palestinian children,” Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor has described the human rights abuses documented in the film as “intolerable”. But rights groups have slammed this statement, saying that the Israelis are doing nothing to change Tel Aviv's policy to torture Palestinian children. Last year a report by the United Nations International Emergency Children's Fund or UNICEF concluded that Palestinian children are often targeted in night arrests and raids of their homes, threatened with death and subjected to physical violence, solitary confinement and sexual assault. The film Stone Cold Justice has sparked an international outcry about Israel's treatment of children in Israeli jails. However, rights groups have criticized Tel Aviv for not doing anything to create a policy that protects Palestinian children against arbitrary arrest and torture.""",allaboutgold,https://x.com/allaboutgold,"Melbourne, Australia",20730,7325,2009-03-30,5996,322,4719,Australia,False,True

God said BEGINNING in September, I will turn everything around.

Was Feinstein's death symbolic of what's to come this fall? BEGINNING in September?

What else is said?

In September, He says that the enemies of Israel shall suddenly turn and CHANGE their tune? We now see a historic peace deal with Saudi Arabia. If you didn't know, Saudi was declared an enemy state to Israel. That's changing.

""Saudi and Israel, quietly declare deal of the century.""

Kim prophesied we would have Strange July and unusual temperatures. We see the alien narrative placed in July along with plane lady. Also counting for the hottest temps on record apparently. All of this ""moving into the fall where there shall be a great fall.""

He also states in the September prophecy that ""as David (Trump, presidency) was getting ready to take back what was stolen from him"" this would all be unfolding.

Then of course he prophecies in the fall you will realize God's chosen David (Trump, been prophesied many times.)

Now Trump has made some comments recently that ""in less than 5 months we would defeat crooked Joe Biden."" 

People talk about the primaries but that still doesn't make any sense...unless something else is about to happen.

We have the trial in Georgia where Sidney Powell will lead the trial (Re-litigation of the 2020 election). If you recall, two years ago Sidney said Georgia would be the first state she would take down in regard to election fraud.

Is something so big going to be revealed in regard to the 2020 election fraud that proves Trump won? For the world to see? It's now being televised I believe. 

What did Kim Clement prophesy? ""Hypnotic November.""

Are you tracking all these things unfolding?

Very well.

First, there was money to be made, and the people behind this agenda put nothing, not even Jewish lives, ahead of money. Secondly, to get away with pulling something like this, you have to make it look good. Thirdly, some doses of “vaccine” were less lethal than others. Fourthly, Israel can hardly be called “nonwhite” on the basis of skin tone. And fifthly, the Ashkenazim seem to be less susceptible to the Covid 19/mRNA spike protein than any other group (the Amish and Chinese are close behind, but the Amish refuse “vaccines” and the Chinese used a different kind of vaccine entirely).

But let’s not split hairs. Even if none of this were true, most “little Jews” would still be quite dispensable to the Ziobanksters of Big Jew Inc., who value them only as human shields and scapegoats and only need a few for that purpose. There’s only one world presently available for the looting - that’s why it’s called “globalism”, you see - and this world has already been sacked, pillaged, and stuffed into the World Bankster portfolio like acorns in the bulging cheek pouches of a monster squirrel.

For the culprits, the object now is to reduce the split. That means reducing the number of beneficiaries. Fewer to share the loot means bigger shares!

(You just have to know how a Big Bankster thinks. When the banksters and their corporate flunkies talk about “saving the world” for a “brighter and more sustainable future”, they’re not talking about our future. The whole idea is that we’ll be gone. The future they’re talking about is theirs.)",RealChrisLangan,https://x.com/RealChrisLangan,Unknown,66802,29,2020-01-15,1554,34,347,Unknown,False,True

Azerbaijan has heavily invested in lobbying in Israel at a government and PR level. They even have a fancy tourist center set up on the beach in Tel Aviv. This is a known tactic of Aliyev, who is an anti-democratic dictator as much as he “supports” Israel. 

One of the most unpleasant tactics I’ve seen is their buying off of journalists, public figures, and the media. I have personally witnessed utterly false claims being made both in private and public to the Israeli media by the Azeri lobby, which also pressures and harasses Israeli journalists when it comes to speaking out about Armenia. This is not the behavior of an “ally” certainly not of a democratic nation which respects free press. 

As a journalist myself, I’ve been invited on “educational tours” sponsored by the Azeri government more than once (which I refused). Many of my peers have both been invited and have gone themselves. I know of cases in which “important people” were literally given gifts of gold Jewellery by the Azeri government during their visit. This is their strategic approach, buttering up key journalists and public figures and bombarding them with false information.

Azerbaijan has an aggressive global political agenda and spends an incredible amount of money lobbying Israel (and others) to promote it — money that Armenia simply doesn’t have. In another example, the Azeri lobby in Israel was behind the effort to essentially trick over 30 MKs into signing a letter supporting separatism in Iran in the Azeri provinces. Once I exposed this, more than 25 of them rescinded their signatures. This is emblematic of the Azeri lobby: dishonest, deceptive and loaded with money. But Azerbaijan, there are some people you can’t buy. 

For months, the Azeri regime has been promoting a completely false and fabricated narrative that the Azeris are Israel in this scenario with Armenia and they’re just “defending themselves” against “terrorists.” This is rooted in pan-Turkic ideology that seeks the complete destruction of the first Christian nation in the world (Armenia).

This is a blatant lie used justify ethnic cleansing from the disputed territory of #NagornoKarabakh, an area of 120,000 ethnic Armenians, historically Armenian for thousands of years, that’s surrounded by Azeris. This territory is surrounded by Azerbaijan because of how the Soviets drew the boundaries after the fall of the USSR. Azerbaijan has launched multiple wars and a blockade to drive our Armenians from their land, and they are much more powerful thanks to Israeli weapons. 

After the 2020 war, despite the risks, Armenia had offered to give up territorial claims in exchange for the guarantee that the Armenians in the territory will be protected — as Azerbaijan has previously committed massacres and ethnic cleansing of Armenian cities. In Nakhichevan, another territory which was historically Armenian but drawn into modern Azerbaijan’s borders, the Azeris destroyed 98% of the historical and religious sites of Armenians, attempting to erase their connection to the land, after a shameful campaign of ethnic cleansing.

Instead of agreeing to protect the human rights of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh today, Azerbaijan launched another war against Armenians including attacking civilian targets. This comes after months of incitement to violence and dehumanisation of Armenians by the Azeri government and media. 

If you see Israelis “supporting” Azerbaijan, just know that it’s the result of an ugly, organized, premeditated lobbying campaign of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan does NOT have shared values with the state of Israel, it is NOT a democracy — it’s a dictatorship, and dictatorships are not true allies.",emilykschrader,https://x.com/emilykschrader,Israel,143058,1397,2012-01-29,1849,103,763,Israel,False,True

Firstly the premise that Hamas must be eliminated to achieve peace is fallacious; peace can be achieved by eliminating the abuses and righting the wrongs which gave rise to Hamas in the first place. There's no rational reason to believe Hamas would continue to exist in its current iteration or keep waging violent resistance if the theft and injustice from 1948 onward were rolled back, refugees had the right to return, apartheid abuses were ended, and people were no longer kept in a giant concentration camp where they are deprived of basic human needs.

Secondly the premise that you can bomb people into accepting an abusive status quo is self-evidently absurd. Even if Israel kills every single member of Hamas, there will be hundreds of thousands of survivors of this onslaught who see the depravity of Israel and refuse to accept it. You think all these orphaned boys and all these men who saw their loved ones ripped apart by military explosives are just going to be cool with the status quo from here on out? Of course not.

And Israel knows this, which is why its preferred solution is to kick all survivors of this onslaught out of Gaza and into refugee camps in the Sinai desert. It knows that nothing it's doing will actually work and it refuses to make the reparations that will work, so its only other option is the elimination of Gazans one way or the other. Ethnic cleansing and mass displacement is not ""peace"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it might allow Israel to keep its abusive status quo intact.

Those are Israel's only real options for sustainable stability: either right all the wrongs which led to this, or go the opposite direction and inflict far more wrongs to answer the Palestinian question once and for all. It's pretty clear watching all this that Israel has opted for the latter.",caitoz,https://x.com/caitoz,Australia,378295,3581,2009-02-02,8757,182,3550,Australia,False,True

Hafez al-Assad’s orders were to completely annihilate Zahle and its Christian population - and the Palestinians gladly offered to take part in it. For 6 months Zahle endured intense shelling and was completely cut off from the outside world.

The Lebanese Christian diaspora held prostests and demonstrations calling for humanitarian aid and a ceasefire, and even Pope John Paul II called for the stop of the onslaught. But the Syrians and Palestinians were determined in finishing what they started.

But after months of destruction, death, blood, and tears, the Lebanese Christian resistance, despite being greatly outnumbered, somehow miraculously defeated the Syrians and Palestinians. The city was completely destroyed, but the population started rebuilding the city as soon as the invaders were expelled.

Below is a picture of Our Lady of Zahle overlooking the city.",realMaalouf,https://x.com/realMaalouf,Unknown,18369,768,2020-10-16,8464,210,2888,Unknown,False,True

The Palestinian Authority’s official policy is to SHOOT and POISON all stray dogs and cats. 

Stray dogs and cats subjected to this die in absolute agony. 

Those poisoned convulse in seizures. 

Those shot are often wounded and left to die slowly from their injuries. 

Palestinian civilians are also encouraged to kill dogs. 

In 2022 the mayor of Hebron, in West Bank offered citizens $5 for every dog they killed. 

These tactics are so normalized that Palestinian municipalities post notices warning citizens not to be alarmed by impending gunfire, and post pictures of bloodied dogs on their Facebook pages, claiming to have made streets safer for people.

A former Prime Minister saying that France is becoming ""a very diminished nation"" (""un très petit pays""), notably due to the country's reduction in freedom of thought and speech with regard to Israel.

This was Dominique de Villepin, who was responding to accusations of antisemitism made against him, because he'd been very critical of Israel and of the censorship of Israel's critics. Here's a complete translation of what he said, as always extraordinarily well expressed:

""All roads lead to Rome, but not all paths of criticism lead to antisemitism. It is possible to criticize the United States without being necessarily antisemitic. One can criticize the messianic Zionism of a part of the Israeli government without being antisemitic. One can support the idea of justice for the Palestinian people without being antisemitic. One can question an economic, cultural, financial system... As far as I know, a former [french] president of the republic campaigned denouncing the power of finance, he was not antisemitic!

Essentially, in all the questions you ask me, what is the goal? What is the purpose behind you and those who prepare this kind of questioning? It is to make sure that I remain silent... By constantly wanting to limit our ability to express ourselves, by no longer being able to say anything in the media under the pretext that it might mean [this or that] or be inconvenient, by tracking all forms of thought that can overshadow a strategy or policy, we are becoming what we are turning into, that is, a very diminished nation. 

Look at the United States, what is happening there? In the United States, within the Democratic Party, which is not known for its antisemitism, a major revolt is taking place regarding Israel. A generational revolt, a political revolt. And within the Jewish community itself, linked to the relationship between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, there is also a revolt organizing.

You know, what I think about first and foremost by telling you this is the interests of Israel, the interest of the Jewish community: it is necessary to help oneself, that is, not to put oneself in a situation where one risks fueling criticism. So I believe it takes a lot of lucidity, a great deal of rigor, a little bit of courage, to try to assert one's ideas and convictions.""",RnaudBertrand,https://x.com/RnaudBertrand,Unknown,221819,1016,2009-05-28,10854,166,4616,Unknown,False,True

For 30yrs+, Saleem has collected private papers, rare books, manuscripts & historical documents from the people of Gaza relating to the history of Palestine.

Shortly before Oct 7, I was fortunate enough to visit his shop in Gaza City. I purchased 100s of documents dating from the 1910s-1960s.

Since Oct. 7th, the Israeli military bombed Saleem's home. Saleem believes his shop, which housed the literary heritage of the Palestinian people of Gaza, has been destroyed during Israel's genocidal rampage.

I'm sharing 200+ documents I received from Saleem for the first time now.

You can download them for free in the ""Gaza Collection"" here, in the folder titled ""ملف غير محدد""

https://t.co/egU5SjZNts

In total, the Gaza Collection now includes 600+ documents, all of them purchased from Saleem.

Holocaust survivor @DrGaborMate tells @piersmorgan although he “used to be a Zionist” he now believes the occupation must end and land should be returned to Palestine for there to be peace.

Dr. Gabor Maté started by teaching @piersmorgan that the present situation cannot be understood without the historical context — a brutal history of #occupation for the past 75 years.

“We keep talking about the #Hamas charter. Did you know the #Likud charter, the ruling party in #Israel, excludes a Palestinian entity West of the Jordan River?”

“Piers, you have to go there to see it for yourself, as I have. And you would cry every day for two weeks as well.”

1. ""Palestine"" was under Ottoman rule and was not considered an entity. It was ruled in the form of different districts, and the people there were nothing but subjects who came and passed.

2. 1918-1948 Great Britain ran a MANDATE, NOT A STATE, in this region to establish a Jewish state, but later changed into two separate states, one Jewish, one Arab. They announced the plan in 1947, which enraged the Arabs who wanted ALL OF IT and started a civil war, although the Jews purchased their lands. Apparently, being given a state that they would never have received under the Ottoman Empire wasn't good enough.

3. 1948: Civil war escalated. Jews declared Israel. Arabs declared war on Israel with the aim of GETTING RID OF THE JEWS AND TAKING THE ENTIRE LAND!!!

Guess what? THEY LOST BADLY!

So, Israel took more than initially assigned. Egypt occupied Gaza, Jordan occupied and ANNEXED the West Bank.

During THIS civil war and war, the ""nakba"" happened, which is the flight and expulsion of Arabs who were not allowed to come back. It didn't happen because Israel didn't want Arabs.

4. 1967: Israel responded to Arab states, which were lining up troops and instating blockades, by declaring war, which resulted in occupying large amounts of land.

5. 1973-1983 Israel gave Sinai back to Egypt in return for peace and recognition.

6. Israel was officially in control of Gaza and the West Bank but worked toward self-governance for the Palestinian Arabs, which even led to Israel recognizing the Palestinian Authority as a legitimate government under which Palestine could become a sovereign state.

7. 2005: Israel completely left Gaza and removed all Jewish settlements, some by force. Israel left a blockade in place that would be gradually lifted. Gaza elected Hamas, which had the clear mission of wanting to ERADICATE THE JEWS and DESTROY ISRAEL and NEVER MAKE PEACE, from where it went downhill.

- Israel did not ""steal"" land at any point.
- Israel gave land and autonomy to work toward peace
⬇️⬇️⬇️
- Gaza & West Bank are only autonomous entities today because Israel ALLOWED it, which, as it seems now, was probably a bad decision.
⬆️⬆️⬆️
- If Israel was the genocidal bad guy, there would be no ""Palestinians"" left after 1967.

1. That genocide is bad, and it must end.

2. That our government's MUST stop using our tax money to fund a genocide.

3. That the Palestinians DESERVE their autonomy as a people and DESERVE their freedom.

So why ruin it?

Why let our own quibbles on other issues, come in the way of us COLLECTIVELY trying to prevent a genocide? 

Put yourself in the shoes of someone in Gaza for a second.

Do you think a Palestinian in Gaza, who’s witnessing innocent civilians dying in the hundreds DAILY, would want us arguing amongst ourselves?

Come on, be for real.

They need WHATEVER support they can get.

They need AS MUCH noise to be made as possible.

The mainstream media, politicians, celebrities, influencers, corporations, social media companies and paid propaganda accounts are ALL against them.

Why should we let our own personal quarrels come in the way of having the BIGGEST impact possible?

As for where my political identity lies, (as I’ve seen many people label my account all sorts of things), I’ll address that too.

I do not identify with the left nor do I identify with the right.

I am not a liberal, nor am I a conservative.

I believe blindly aligning yourself FULLY with any political side, is akin to joining a cult.

If you assess a situation, form an opinion, but then sacrifice said opinion because it doesn’t fit the narrative of the political identity that you’ve aligned yourself with, then I believe that to be quite a problem.

I don’t believe you should sacrifice any of your beliefs, just because it is not the majority opinion of the political movement you decided to align yourself with.

So to summarize,

 ⁃ We should’t fight amongst ourselves due to differing opinions on other matters, it doesn't help the Palestinians.

 ⁃ We should work together to make the biggest impact possible.

 ⁃ I am neither Conservative nor Liberal, I formulate my own opinions based on the way I assess each individual situation and I believe you should too.

Click 'Show more' to read the statement in full:

The Elders call for Israel to comply immediately with the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to protect Palestinians in Gaza from acts of genocide.

The Elders also call for Israel’s allies to publicly affirm their respect for the Court’s ruling, and to use the political, military and financial leverage at their disposal to ensure Israel’s compliance with the provisional measures.

The ICJ’s legally binding decision is a moment of the utmost gravity.

Israeli forces have killed over 25,000 Palestinians in Gaza, destroyed homes and infrastructure across the territory and displaced up to 1.9 million people. The Elders share the Court’s judgement that this scale of devastation risks causing irreparable harm to the people of Gaza.

Israel, as the occupying military power, must comply with the Court’s ruling and implement the provisional measures in full. This includes ensuring its military does not commit any acts of genocide against the Palestinian people as a protected group, including killing members of the group. It also includes preventing incitement to genocide, and enabling provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. An immediate step must be to lift the siege of Gaza and end the collective punishment of Palestinians.

The Elders support the Court’s emphasis that all parties to the conflict are bound by international humanitarian law, and its call for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups.

All states have a responsibility to respect the Court’s ruling. South Africa has shown moral leadership in bringing this case, and it is now incumbent on others – particularly Israel’s allies and the UN Security Council – to live up to their own moral and legal obligations to prevent acts of genocide, and support the ICJ’s ruling.

As a minimum, Israel’s allies must ensure they are not complicit in any atrocity crimes. The Elders thus reiterate their call for all countries providing military assistance to Israel to place this under review and set new conditions for future provision. Governments which provide military assistance in the knowledge that atrocities are being committed, or may be imminent, risk being complicit. Self-defence can never be a justification for atrocity crimes.

For too long, Israel’s allies – particularly the United States and many European states – have provided political cover for its violations of international law. This impunity must end now.

Political leaders who choose to disregard or undermine the Court’s ruling risk further weakening the international rule of law at a time when it is already acutely under threat. The UN Security Council has a vital role in ensuring compliance with the ICJ ruling and upholding the consistent application of international law. The world is watching.

The 152 mile barrier goes from the Israeli city of Eilat in the south to the Gaza–Israel border in the north.

It took three years to construct for $450 million.

That equates to $3m a mile.  

They began building in Nov 2010 and completed in Dec 2013.

Just in the first half of 2012, roughly 9570 people illegally crossed the border.

In 2016, that number dropped to just 16 the entire year.  

Meanwhile, the US-Mexico border is 1,954 miles long (from San Diego, California to Texas at the Gulf of Mexico).

1,954 miles X $3m = $5.8 billion.  

Let’s add inflation and the fact that US Government ALWAYS over pays for projects, we can get this done for less than $10-$20 billion.

From 2020 to 2023 we’ve had 8 million illegal immigrants cross the border.

I watched the uncensored video of US airman Aaron Bushnell self-immolating in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington while screaming “Free Palestine”. I hesitated to watch it because I knew once I put it into my mind it’s there for the rest of my life, but I figured I owe him that much.

I feel like I’ve been picked up and shaken, which I suppose was pretty much what Bushnell was going for. Something to shake the world awake to the reality of what’s happening. Something to snap us out of the brainwashed and distracted stupor of western dystopia and turn our gaze to Gaza.

The sounds stay with you more than the sights. The sound of his gentle, youthful, Michael Cera-like voice as he walked toward the embassy. The sound of the round metal container he stored the accelerant in getting louder as it rolls toward the camera. The sound of Bushnell saying “Free Palestine”, then screaming it, then switching to wordless screams when the pain became too overwhelming, then forcing out one more “Free Palestine” before losing his words for good. The sound of the cop screaming at him to get on the ground over and over again. The sound of a first responder telling police to stop pointing guns at Bushnell’s burning body and go get fire extinguishers.

He remained standing for an unbelievable amount of time while he was burning. I don’t know where he got the strength to do it. He remained standing long after he’d stopped vocalizing.

Bushnell was taken to the hospital, where independent reporter Talia Jane reports that he has died. It was about as horrific a death as a human being can experience, and it was designed to be.

Shortly before his final act in this world, Bushnell posted the following message on Facebook:

“Many of us like to ask ourselves, ‘What would I do if I was alive during slavery? Or the Jim Crow South? Or apartheid? What would I do if my country was committing genocide?’

“The answer is, you’re doing it. Right now.”

Aaron Bushnell has provided his own answer to this challenge. We’re all providing our own right now.

I would never do what Bushnell did, and I would never recommend anyone else does either. That said, I also can’t deny that his action is having its intended effect: drawing attention to the horrors that are happening in Gaza.

I know this is true because everywhere I see Aaron Bushnell being discussed online I see a massive deluge of pro-Israel trolls frantically swarming the comments in a mad rush to manipulate the narrative. They all understand how destructive it is to US and Israeli information interests for people to be seeing an international news story about a member of the US Air Force self-immolating on camera while screaming “Free Palestine”, and they are doing everything they can to mitigate that damage.

As I write this, there are with absolute certainty people digging through Bushnell’s history searching for dirt that can be spun as evidence that he was a bad person, that he was mentally ill, that he was steered astray by pro-Palestine activists and dissident media — whatever they can make stick. If they find something, literally anything, the smearmeisters and propagandists will run with it as far as they can.

That’s what they’re choosing to do at this point in history. That’s what they would have done during slavery, or the Jim Crow south, or apartheid. That’s what they’re doing while their country commits genocide right now. People are showing what they would have done with their response to Gaza, and they’re showing what they would have done with their response to the self-immolation of Aaron Bushnell.

I’m not going to link to the video here; watching it is a personal decision on which you should probably do your own legwork to make sure it’s really what you want. Whether you watch it or not, it happened, just like the incineration of Gaza is happening right now. We each own our personal response to that reality. This is who we are.",caitoz,https://x.com/caitoz,Australia,378295,3581,2009-02-02,17260,374,6899,Australia,False,True

Who has ISIS attacked over the past 4 months during Israel's war on Gaza?

(1) Turkey in January
(2) Iran in January
(3) Afghanistan just now
(4) (likely) Russia just now

Know that all Muslims hate ISIS - a fact confirmed by every poll.

This is because although they pretend to represent Islam, their actions of intentionally killing women and children are a blatant violation of the Sharia. Moreover, their actions are calculated to harm rather than help Muslims.

How exactly does it help Muslims or Palestinians to launch bombing attacks on Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and Russia?

If past behavior is any indication, one can expect future ISIS attacks on Qatar, Yemen, Lebanon, Algeria, China, South Africa, Ireland, and Latin America.

It is widely recognized that ISIS is a false flag operation run by Israeli intelligence to harm Muslims.

This is in keeping with Israel's long history of false flag operations targeting Muslims, including the Bombing of the King David Hotel, the Lavon Affair, the US liberty attack, and the [REDACTED] in 2001.

In the case of the recent false flag attack on Russia, it is likely that Israel's partner the CIA was involved. The US and Israel have a shared interest in destroying Russia - and this ISIS attack is like the recent US false flag bombing of Nordstream.

Also please do not say that false flags are simply a ""conspiracy theory."" Not only are there many proven false flags from the past, but the US is continuously accusing other governments (especially Russia) of carrying out false flags.   

The only reason why the public is not aware of these basic facts is that Israel and the ADL control social media companies like facebook, youtube, (increasingly twitter), and (likely in the future) Tiktok.

When the Australians give the island back to the Aborigines.  

And the New Zealanders give it back to the Maori. 

When the Americans and the Canadians and the Spanish give the whole continent back to the Natives.

Alaska to the Eskimos.

Hawaii to Hawaiians. 
 
When China frees Tibet. 

When South Africa returns to the original Africans. 

When Egypt return Sinai to the Bedouin and Pakistan will be India again. 

When the Swedes and Norwegians and Swedes give the land to the Sami. 

When the English frees Ireland and Scotland. 

When France returns to the Gauls
and Iraq to Babylonians. 

And Persia  is Sumer again

Then and only then will we gladly give our land back.

To the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Moabites, the Girgashites, the Hittites, the Midianites and the Levites.

Heed my warning.

Raised with an infinite love for Palestine and a profound animosity towards Jews and Israel, I adhered sincerely to these beliefs because they were all I knew. During my pursuit of knowledge, I lived with a Jewish family in France in 2010, an experience that unveiled realities previously unknown or misrepresented to me in my youth. Radical Islamism conceals the truth, coercing its adherents to embrace falsehoods and reject substantial and historical truths.

I assure you, I am not an agent compensated for my activism; I have paid the price for speaking out. Why do I persist? Because I was once deceived by the very lies and misconceptions I earnestly believed. This is why I implore you to heed my warning: justice for Palestinians cannot be achieved through mass intimidation and protests that deface your national symbols. You are unfamiliar with the true significance of their chants; you do not understand Arabic nor are you well-versed in the culture.

I genuinely care for the innocent Palestinians and advocate for Israelis and Palestinians to coexist peacefully. However, I am unequivocally opposed to Hamas and radical Islamists, knowing them far more intimately than you could imagine. I understand how they lead their followers to peril.

I have endeavored to grasp the intentions behind many ""Pro-Palestine"" activists. They seek the destruction of Israel, the annihilation of Jews, and they propagate hatred vehemently. You do not comprehend their language—I do, as a native Arab. Trust me, I am acutely aware of the racism and misconduct that can be obscured by radical Islam.

I urge you to remain alert, to see through their camouflage and disguise. Be vigilant. 

You will thank me later. I promise.",lalshareef,https://x.com/lalshareef,Abu Dhabi,201743,1835,2009-04-15,7035,160,2341,United Arab Emirates,False,True

tweet,2024-04-28 00:00:31+00:00,https://twitter.com/DovWaxman/status/1784372085374288137,"I’m a scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a longtime advocate for peace and for Palestinian rights. I have publicly opposed Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, and its blockade and now destruction of Gaza. I support the rights of students and faculty to peacefully protest against Israel, including by establishing protest encampments, such as the one on my campus at UCLA. I do not want these protest camps to be removed by the police, whose propensity for unnecessary and excessive use of force is well-established.

As a Jew, I do not personally feel threatened or unsafe because of the protest encampment at UCLA. I know some of the students taking part and believe they are well-intentioned. Many, probably most, of the protesters are simply horrified by the mass killing and near-famine in Gaza and want it to end. So do I. But I cannot join this protest because it is not just a protest against the war in Gaza.

Among the demands of the protest organizers is the demand to “sever all UC-wide connections to Israeli universities, including study abroad programs, fellowships, seminars, and research collaborations, and UCLA’s Nazarian Center.” Needless to say, I oppose the demand to boycott the Nazarian Center, which I direct. The Center is devoted to the academic study of Israel and has no ties to the Israeli government. I also oppose boycotting Israeli academic institutions and academic boycotts in general.

But it isn’t only the demands of the protest organizers that I have a problem with. One of the organizations behind the protest, Students for Justice in Palestine, has expressed support for Hamas and has even celebrated the massacre of Israelis on October 7. Being in solidarity with Palestinians does not necessitate supporting Hamas. On the contrary, Hamas oppresses Palestinians and has no concern for the lives of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. They have openly stated that they are willing to sacrifice countless Palestinian lives—“martyrs”—for their cause, which is the ultimate eradication of Israel. They have spent billions building a vast underground network to protect themselves and their weaponry, but they haven’t built a single bomb shelter for Gazan civilians or sheltered them in their tunnels. They are prolonging the devastating war in Gaza, and the humanitarian crisis there, in order to maintain their power and authoritarian rule in Gaza.

I know that many people in the pro-Palestinian movement don’t support Hamas and don’t praise the October 7 massacre, but groups like SJP lead the movement on many college campuses, exploiting the sympathy that many students rightly feel for the suffering of Palestinians. Students and faculty demonstrating in support of Palestinians shouldn’t ignore the fact that the organizers of these demonstrations are, in many cases, ideologically committed to eradicating Israel and expelling Israeli Jews, supportive of violence against Israeli civilians, and willing to ignore or even justify Hamas’ strategy of sacrificing Palestinian civilians for their political ends.",DovWaxman,https://x.com/DovWaxman,"Los Angeles, CA",12640,1185,2011-06-14,10098,533,2074,United States of America,False,True
